                    <h5 class="card-title">Holy Week</h5>
                    <div class="col-sm-3">
                    <p class="card-text">Holy Week in Bohol, as in other parts of the Philippines, is a significant religious observance. It is a time when people reflect on the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The week usually begins with Palm Sunday, which commemorates Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Throughout the week, many people participate in religious processions and reenactments of the events leading up to Christ's crucifixion, such as the Stations of the Cross. On Maundy Thursday, the Last Supper is commemorated, and many churches hold a washing of the feet ceremony. Good Friday is a solemn day, with many people fasting and attending church services.</p>    
                    <p class="card-text">One unique tradition in Bohol during Holy Week is the "Penitensya," where some people engage in self-flagellation or other forms of self-mortification as a way of expressing their faith and seeking penance for their sins. However, this practice is not encouraged by the Catholic Church.</p>    
                    <p class="card-text">Holy Week in Bohol is also a time for family gatherings and visits to relatives. Many people take the opportunity to return to their hometowns and spend time with loved ones. It is also a time when many tourists visit the island to witness the religious observances and participate in cultural activities.</p>
