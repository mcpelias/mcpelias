                    <p class="card-text">The Chocolate Hills are a geological formation located in the Bohol province of the Philippines. The hills are spread over an area of 50 square kilometers and consist of over 1,200 individual mounds that are mostly uniform in shape and height. The hills are covered in green grass which turns brown during the dry season, giving them their chocolate-like appearance.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">The origin of the Chocolate Hills is still a matter of debate among geologists, with some suggesting that they are limestone formations that have undergone weathering and erosion over millions of years. The hills are a popular tourist destination in Bohol, with visitors often climbing the stairs of the observation deck at the Chocolate Hills Complex to get a panoramic view of the hills. There are also various legends associated with the Chocolate Hills, including a story about two giants who threw rocks and sand at each other in a fight that lasted for several days, creating the hills in the process.</p>
